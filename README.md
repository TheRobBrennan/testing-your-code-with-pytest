# Welcome

This project explores my thoughts and ideas while reviewing the free ~25-minute [Testing Your Code With Pytest](https://realpython.com/courses/testing-your-code-with-pytest/) course.

## Getting started

First things first. Let's download the slides and the sample code for this free course.

NOT SO FAST.

![You can have it...once you pay us](./assets/download-permission-denied-02.png)

Well, that's a bit of a downer. I wasn't expecting a paywall to prevent me from downloading course material. My suggestion? Either make it a paid course upfront or remove this silliness. This is dumb. üëéüèª

Make sure that you have created a virtual environment for development:

```sh
# Verify that you have Python installed on your machine
% python3 --version
Python 3.11.1

# Create a new virtual environment for the project
% python3 -m venv .venv

# Select your new environment by using the Python: Select Interpreter command in VS Code
#   - Enter the path: ./.venv/bin/python

# Activate your virtual environment
% source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) %
```

Please see [CHEAT-SHEET-PYTHON.md](./CHEAT-SHEET-PYTHON.md) for more examples of getting started with Python development on your machine.
