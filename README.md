# Welcome

This project explores my thoughts and ideas while reviewing the free ~25-minute [Testing Your Code With Pytest](https://realpython.com/courses/testing-your-code-with-pytest/) course.

## Getting started

First things first. Let's download the slides and the sample code for this free course.

NOT SO FAST.

Well, that's a bit of a downer. I wasn't expecting a paywall to prevent me from downloading course material. My suggestion? Either make it a paid course upfront or remove this silliness. This is dumb. 👎🏻
